Ophion is a fork of charybdis, which itself was based on ircd-ratbox.
Its development is lead by a team of friendly developers who have put
a lot of time into the project, and we'd like to hear from you!

For more information about contributions to predecessors of this
project, see doc/credits-past.txt in the Ophion source distribution.
